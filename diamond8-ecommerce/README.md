### Simple React App

### libraries used :

1. React Router DOM
2. Bootstrap styles


### Rendering with React

1. Just returned the html from my previous project diamond8-ecommerce
2. So easy to build component based web-apps

## the folder structure is self-explanatory

### Things I learnt :

1. using require to show images inside JSX.
2. Converting any html,css code into a React web-app.

### there will not be the images folders on my github repo

1. Due to more than 100 files in the imgs folder.
2. The imgs just act as a placeholder. They are static images.
3. THe important thing is the responsive layout, so imgs are not much necessary.
